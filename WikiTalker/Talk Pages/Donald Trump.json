If they had been, I think most of them would have supported omission because they believe in generally following guidelines for the sake of site-wide consistency. That's been my experience. The guidance is oddly placed at the end of the template doc's lead, rather than as part of the {{para|successor}} parameter description, so it could be easily missed even by editors who know about template doc and how to view it.{{pb}}{{tq|Either every other page is wrong, or this one is.}} Agree, and I'd say the former. As I've said previously, if any editor believes that a large number of errors resulting from editor unawareness (as opposed to fully informed decisions) means they are no longer errors, they are free to seek to change the template doc to reflect that.

If we feel site-wide consistency is a worthwhile goal, and I believe we do, the only way to get editors on the same page is to have a common, central place to go for that kind of information.

Media outlets are projecting Biden as the winner, because at present, per the rules of a US election (as I have seen on the Guardian) he is not technically the winner until counts are completed and the Electoral College makes its votes. Remember, per the US democractic process, the popular votes does not dictate the winner - it dictates how the Electoral College in each state votes: if Democrats win the state, that college votes for their candidate, and vice versa. There are exceptions - both Nebraska and Maine have given a vote to the opposing candidate that didn't win that state. Let me clarify more with this extract from the Guardian's current live blog:\n\n<blockquote>\"Although Democratic nominee Joe Biden is now president-elect Joe Biden, there are still quite a few steps left in the US electoral process. He is projected to win, but a few more things have to take place before it becomes official. Here’s what happens now, and when it has to be done by.\n\nWhen American citizens vote for a presidential candidate, they really are voting for electors in their state. Those electors in most cases are committed to support the voters’ candidate of choice. The number of electors is equal to the number of electoral votes held by each state.\n\n8 December: this is the deadline for resolving election disputes at the state level. All state recounts and court contests over presidential election results are to be completed by this date.\n\n14 December: electors vote by paper ballot in their respective state capitols and also in the District of Columbia, which while it is the seat of the US government, is not actually a state. Thirty-three states and DC have laws or party regulations requiring electors to vote the same way the popular vote goes in the state. In some states, electors can even be replaced or subjected to penalties if they do not toe the line. An elector who doesn’t vote according to who won the popular vote is known as a “faithless elector”. The votes for president and vice-president are counted and the electors sign six “certificates of the vote”. The certificates, along with other official papers, are sent by registered mail to various officials, including the president of the Senate.\n\n23 December: the certificates must be delivered to the designated officials.\n\n6 January 2021: the House and Senate hold a joint session to count the electoral votes. If one ticket has received 270 or more electoral votes, the president of the Senate, currently vice-president Mike Pence, announces the results.\"</blockquote>\n\nThus the line \"Biden is projected to win\" or \"Trump is projected to lose\" is currently correct, in terms of the stage the election process is in.","user":"GUtt01"},{"date":"2020-11-13T22:58:00Z","id":306,"parent_id":304,"section":"In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, major news organizations have projected that Trump lost his bid for re-election.","text":"{{strike|I'm not sure how the indenting is going in this thread so sorry for my likely violation of [[MOS:LISTGAP]] here, please anyone feel free to fix.

Are we able to say something close to this? The problem is that the article's author isn't saying it unequivocally themselves (they're attributing it to \"many experts\"). I still think that \"Trump reacted slowly\" isn't good enough for Wikipedia, as you said, it's euphemistic and if a scientific journal article isn't ready to state something like this without attribution, how can we do so as an encyclopedia? As a Brit looking in, it doesn't seem consistent (for example, by deaths per capita, Boris Johnson's response has been equally inept and deadly; much of the UK press has been utterly witheringly critical and you'd have an easy time finding RS saying that his government's response was deadly slow, yet the [[Boris Johnson]] article doesn't say \"Johnson reacted slowly\"). In my view, we either need to (1) take a route around such analytical wording in the lead until the sources are in place, while retaining the scathing facts (my suggestion) (2) attribute it (like Nature, as the current text [[Special:Diff/988445856|introduced]] by {{u|Wikieditor19920}} does, or (3) be more explicit, as you're suggesting, if we can find an uncontested and uncontroversial factual statement that's more explanatory.
