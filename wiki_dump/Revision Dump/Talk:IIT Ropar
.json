As soon as there is such a \"non-trivial history\", page moves become impossible without deleting the old history first. Blanking the page won't do it, and in fact adds a non-trivial edit to the history, thus making the move impossible if it wasn't already. In this case, there were already two edits in the history before you got there, so it didn't matter. -", "user": "GTBacchus"}, {"date": "2010-01-03T15:36:00Z", "id": 2, "parent_id": 1, "section": "Survey", "text": "Feel free to state your position on the renaming proposal by beginning a new line in this section with <code><nowiki>*Support</nowiki></code> or <code><nowiki>*Oppose</nowiki></code>, then sign your comment with <code><nowiki>~~~~</nowiki></code>.
