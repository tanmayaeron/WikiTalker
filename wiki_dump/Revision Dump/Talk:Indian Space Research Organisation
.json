As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment.

Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences. Since the Indian space program, as of now, remains nothing else but mere speculation the article on it should be merged with [[ISRO]] under the section future plans.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles.

Press interviews are often superficial rather than factual statements.<br />The [[Space Capsule Recovery Experiment|SCRE]] appears to be the basis of future recoverable spacecraft, manned (e.g. - [[Apollo spacecraft]]) or unmanned (e.g. - Russian [[Parom]]) in theory, to recover a payload from space. It is quite an old technology in terms of the other space agencies closer to Indian space budget. I suppose an advanced recoverable spacecraft would be under a programme directed specifically to achive a manned spacecraft. <br />I have use the word \"basic\" superficially to outline that the [[Space Capsule Recovery Experiment|SCRE]] programme was not enough to justify the statement that India has an active manned space programme.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences. Since the Indian space program, as of now, remains nothing else but mere speculation the article on it should be merged with [[ISRO]] under the section future plans.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles.

I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

As far as I know, apart from India, ESA, Russia, US, China and Japan are the only countries/organizations which have successfully carried out atmospheric reentry and ISRO is the least experienced space organization in this field. I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences.

I definitely agree that SCRE has other uses also, but from the statements being made by ISRO officials ([http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2007/space-070110-voa01.htm see this]), it seems that the primary objective of this program was to master manned spaceflights. ISRO has itself said the SCRE was a prototype of a future space vehicle. US' failure to setup a space station has resulted in a major embarrassment for NASA and US govt. Since then, countries have prevented from making such claims beforehand.  For example, China never publicly announced its plans for manned space missions and anti-satellite missiles. Regarding SCRE being a \"basic\" program, well.. it was ISRO first such experiment. Nonetheless, I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and the material in it should be based on hard concrete evidences. Since the Indian space program, as of now, remains nothing else but mere speculation the article on it should be merged with [[ISRO]] under the section future plans.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

Also we still rely on Russia for GSLV, don't we? \"Mostly\" would be more modest.\n:::Some genius seriously needs to fix the table insertion formatting and the like for the new stuff i inserted from the mother site.. Never thought editing a wiki was easy, thankfully. \n::::Apologies if my work is shoddy. I clearly need to backup my en-thu with some wiki-fu\n\nWe'd add how it was run, if we only knew how it was run. The official website, as mentioned before, is ridiculously useless. And efficient? Please. ISRO's honesty and diligence in continuing to perform largely operational and industrial roles (in INSAT, communication satellites, and Geodesy) belies its loss of direction.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude.

Also, only definining or purpose-related information (and not that of any controversies or scams) should be given in those tables.\n\n: Regarding length: If the [[Antrix Corporation]] article has more controversy content than non-controversy content, then I think the non-controversy (positive or neutral) content may be increased, instead of decreasing the controversy (negative) content.

If anyone wants to spend the time it might be worth doing the GA review anyway - either someone will step up to fix any issues raised, or they can be a useful guide to future editors on what is needed to get to GA. This seems preferable to just removing the nom - we could do this regarding a banned editor but Supdiop doesn't own this or any other article, and if it's close to GA then better we push it over the line.\n\n:Of course this is just one opinion, other views welcome. --", "user": "Euryalus"}, {"date": "2016-05-21T13:39:00Z", "id": 56, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Organisation structure and facilities", "text": "Per [[WP:WHENTABLE]], the current table format with an elaborate explanation for each entry is unneeded.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.

The space agency\u2019s achievements in space are a source of great national pride.\n\nThe 2005 deal between Devas Multimedia and ISRO\u2019s commercial arm, Antrix, involves the space agency building two S-band satellites, GSAT 6 and GSAT 6A, and the company leasing 90 percent of capacity getting use of them to deliver Internet services. ISRO did not actually allocate S-band spectrum to the company, but provided capacity on the satellites to use the spectrum. The scarce S-band spectrum was provided to deal was made with Devas with no competitive bidding. Devas includes two former high-ranking ISRO officials.\n\nCritics have attacked the no-bid deal as having cost the government millions of dollars while benefiting a well-connected company.\n\nThe space agency is not particularly open or candid about its taxpayer-funded work. During the Chandrayaan-1 mission, ISRO went to great lengths to downplay problems with the lunar probe. For example, the agency doubled the spacecraft\u2019s orbit claiming that all work at the lower altitude had been completed. This was false; the real reason was a major system failure that made the spacecraft difficult to control at its original altitude. This news didn\u2019t become public until two months later.  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shikhar D Gupta|Shikhar D Gupta]] ([[User talk:Shikhar D Gupta|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Shikhar D Gupta"}, {"date": "2011-10-23T08:31:00Z", "id": 32, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Future", "text": "hey guys I have removed Megha-Tropiques from future and upcoming satellite section as it has already been launched........  \u2014 Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Vyom25|Vyom25]] ([[User talk:Vyom25|talk]] \u2022", "user": "Vyom25"}, {"date": "2012-07-15T06:57:00Z", "id": 33, "parent_id": 0, "section": "Merging of sections", "text": "The sections [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Extraterrestrial_exploration|Extraterrestrial exploration]] and [[Indian_Space_Research_Organisation#Space_exploration|Space exploration]] must be merged as they have repeat data.
